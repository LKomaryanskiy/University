# NA_lab1
  In this lab i implemented calculation cos function with some error, by using Taylor series. 
  First test demonstrates, how much iterations must be do for calculation with error, that less then eps (10^(-3) <=eps <= 10^(-14) 
    with step by 10^(-3)).
  Second test designed for calculation cos value on interval between a and b with step by a + (a+b) * k, where k = 0.. 10.
  Two tests builds tables, where you can see abs error compared wih standart C cos function, k+1 reminder term and etc.
